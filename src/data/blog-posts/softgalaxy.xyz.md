This page is just a weird guy sharing password-protected Mac software online, waiting for people to beg for the passwords to his files.

I received this message just for comment in facebook about the password:

So thereâ€™s no password unless you pay.

Charging for your services is perfectly fine, but making people waste their time hoping for access you never intended to give is just misleading.

Btw if you want Mac software like (autocad, adobe, matlab, revit...) you can download here:
